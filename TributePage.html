            <strong>1889</strong>
            - Having the funds to now be free to pursue his interests, Nikola Tesla was able to come up with the Tesla Coil with the help of external inspirations. The development of the Tesla coil would later be very useful for his wireless power work.

            - The Nikola Tesla Company was founded with the assistance of his previous colleagues which handled Tesla's patents for the decades to come. The same year, the building that hosted his lab caught fire which not only set back his current projects but destroyed collection of his early notes, research material, models, and demonstration pieces.
            </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1896</strong>
